    ```yml
    platforms:
        - deviceName: Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra
            osVersion: 12.0
            platformName: android
    ```

4. To run your tests using Browserstack Local. Update the `browserstack.yml` with the following key:
    ```yml
    browserstackLocal: true # <boolean> (Default false)
    ```

### Running Tests

- To run tests, execute the following command:
